# Project Goals & Objectives

## Primary Objective

Create a comprehensive, production-ready multi-agent AI workspace configuration that can be copied into any VS Code workspace to enhance AI coding assistance capabilities.

## Success Criteria

-   [x] Consistent AI behavior across GitHub Copilot, Claude-Code, and Codex
-   [x] Comprehensive language support (15+ languages)
-   [x] Auto-formatting and code quality enforcement
-   [x] Clear documentation for setup and usage
-   [x] Easy installation process (script + manual)
-   [ ] Tool alignment for advanced prompt execution
-   [ ] State persistence and session continuity
-   [ ] Architectural analysis capabilities

## Current Status

**Phase**: Tool Integration & Enhancement
**Progress**: 70% - Core workspace complete, now adding advanced capabilities

## Active Goals

1. **Immediate**: Implement state management infrastructure
2. **Short-term**: Add architectural analysis tools
3. **Medium-term**: Enable agent coordination patterns
4. **Long-term**: Full prompt execution capability

## Constraints

-   Must work across multiple AI assistants
-   Configuration should be portable and version-controllable
-   Tools must be non-intrusive and optional
-   Documentation must remain accessible

## Non-Goals

-   Creating a new AI assistant
-   Building VS Code from scratch
-   Replacing existing AI tools
-   Language-specific deep integrations

## Boundaries

-   **In Scope**: Configuration, coordination, best practices
-   **Out of Scope**: Custom AI models, proprietary integrations
-   **Gray Area**: Custom VS Code extensions (document but don't require)

## Drift Detection

Compare current workspace state against these goals every major change.
If drift > 20%, stop and realign.
